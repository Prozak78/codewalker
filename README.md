codewalker
==========

Reads and parses code structures, classes, methods, functions, from files to variables, and their connections.

For now, this is being created to be PHP-specific, but I believe that the base structure can be made to handle most, 
if not all languages.

Output is yet undefined, but most possibly it dumps the parsed data onto a mySQL DataBase created for that effect.

This is the objective for the project, which is still in its infancy.

Thank you,
